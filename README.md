# Battleship game from Head First JavaScript 
This project is taken from the book "Head First JavaScript" and it is a simple battleship game. It will be evolving as I learn more JavaScript. My idea is to finish the project once that my JS skills have improven. 

## Why this project? 
As I'm learning JavaScript by taking freecodecamp's courses and by reading "Head Frist JavaScript", I've realized that the best way to learn how to code is by working on real projects. In addition, I'm sure that structuring my projects correctyly in Github repositories is really useful.
